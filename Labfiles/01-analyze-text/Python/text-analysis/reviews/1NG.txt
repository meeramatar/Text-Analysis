NO Commitment is NO Commitment !! ðŸ‘Ž
Etisalat, a leading UAE service provider, seems to be experiencing declining service quality. As an eLife customer since 2018, I renewed my contract once. However, I haven't renewed it since and have been using the service on a month-to-month basis. Here's the issue: When I was under a contract, my internet speed was 500 Mbps without any issues. Strangely, after the contract ended, my speed increased to 750 Mbps (Free). Despite this increase in Number, the actual internet speed and quality has noticeably decreased. I've filed several complaints about this issue. Etisalat promises a free technician visit if the problem originates from their end. However, the technicians who visit perform no repairs and still charge a fee (150 AED + VAT). Now, they refuse to send a technician, claiming my router is outdated and needs replacement. This doesn't make sense; my router has a capacity of 1 Gbps + 5G. Why should I change it when the internet speed isn't even reaching the current router's capacity? Etisalat's service seems to deteriorate significantly for customers without commitment plans. It feels like they exploit the lack of alternative options. I'm quite disappointed with their service.
