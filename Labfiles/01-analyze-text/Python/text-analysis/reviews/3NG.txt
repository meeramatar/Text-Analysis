Dissatisfaction
Very bad service,they will not inform you everything about their service they just give the bill and cut the service if you didn’t pay on time..They will not tell everything about your plan,i asked one of the customer service about my contract (means everything about my plan)and she maid it clear no fees after the contract end and nothing to do any its automatically end..they never told that even if the contract ends the service still going on and you will still receive a bill…i was shocked I received a bill after and their telling i need to make a cancellation request…and i did but they informed me to clear now the bill and the next bill which is im not using it anymore coz I thought when contracts end service is end also..they just after the money..ofcourse just to clear your name you hve to pay it without any consideration from them…they keep calling upgrading plans but they don’t call if you want to renew your contract or end and make a cancellation request…i regret getting this service.
