It is very easy to use and we can find all the information that we need. Even the last contacted number to the a single fils charged on the post paid number is mentioned and can be easily retrieved. I have one single issue that is, as my credit score is very good with Etisalat, so i am eligible to get any kind of device, but since i dont have own a credit it is not able to process here but i have to visit the branch for that. It would be great if that feature where we check our eligibility and pay the down payment on the Etisalat could be done here as well, i think we wont even need to go to the business center at all.
