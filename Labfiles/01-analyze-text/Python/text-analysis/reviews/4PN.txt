I love using this application and it really helps a lot.
But with regards to updating EID the only option is to capture the front and back side of the ID. Please make it an option as well to upload a file intead of capturing it, by this way it will help those people who are not using camera mobile phones, especially for those who are working in a NO CAMERA allowed WORK PLACE like offshore.
Thanks. Looking forward to the next update of the
App.
