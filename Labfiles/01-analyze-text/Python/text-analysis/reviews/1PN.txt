Your app is very easy to use, safe and fast. I will use the app for everything in the future. But last month I paid the bill through Emirates NBD, but you didn't approve it, stopped my phone service, and asked me to pay the bill again. In order to resume normal use of the phone, I was forced to pay the bill again. I am very curious, communication technology has improved, but your billing system seems to be regressing. I have used this phone number since 2002 without any problems, but I have always encountered problems with your billing system in recent months. I hope you can solve the problem. Thank you.
